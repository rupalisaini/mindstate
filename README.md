# Remind
Final Project for COMP 426

Remind is a mental health tracker for people who would like to understand their mental health condition over a period of time. Using creative color schemes, graphs, and a user-friendly interface, Remind will help people monitor just how well they are doing mentally and how they can bring positive change.
